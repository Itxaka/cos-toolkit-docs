  How to get cOS
---

cOS-toolkit releases consist on container images that can be used to build derived against and the cos source tree itself.
 
cOS is a manifest which assembles an OS from containers, so if you want to make substantial changes to the layout you can also fork directly cOS.

Currently, the toolkit supports creating derivatives from [OpenSUSE, Fedora and Ubuntu](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cOS-toolkit/tree/master/values), although it's rather simple to add support for other OS families and architecures.

The cOS CI generates ISO and images artifacts used for testing, so you can also try out cOS by downloading the 
ISO [from the Github Actions page](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cOS-toolkit/actions/workflows/build.yaml), to the commit you are interested into.
