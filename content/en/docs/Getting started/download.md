  How to get cOS
---

cOS-toolkit releases consist on container images that can be used to build derived against and the cos source tree itself.
 
We are not releasing artifacts currently on tagging - the cOS CI generates ISO and images artifacts used for testing, so you can also try out cOS by downloading the 
artifact type you are interested into [from the Github Actions page](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cOS-toolkit/actions/workflows/build-master.yaml?query=is%3Asuccess) by picking the latest job. The artifacts are listed at the end of the workflow page.
